Hitchhiker's guide to python is not about teaching python. It is more of a guide to the best practices and guidelines to master the language. [More info on https://docs.python-guide.org/]

## My takeaways
This page is my notes from the book.

### Tips

- MacOS guys install homebrew. It is a package manager that the OS is missing :D. Homebrew then automatically installs pip and setuptools(easy_install).
- I prefer pip more than easy_install
- overall regardless of any OS, you should have pip, setuptools, virtualenv.
