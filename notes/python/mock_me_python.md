__What is mocking?__

> mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to __replace parts of your__ 
> __system under test with mock objects__ and __make assertions__ about how they have been used.

You replace parts of __SUT__ with __mock objects__, which are instances of _Mock_ or _MagicMock_ class.

After that you make __assertions__ about the mocked instance which is a way of checking if it is being used as expected or not.
