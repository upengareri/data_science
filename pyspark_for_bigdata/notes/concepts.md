#### What is big data?
In terms of analogy, let's say we have a data (eg. 32GB csv) that we can load in RAM. Well, that's not big data as we can use a single powerful local machine with more RAM to load that file.

But using a huge file for which loading in a single machine with some RAM doesn't make any sense that's when we start using the term big data for.

In that case we can either use -
* _SQL database_ to store onto hard drive instead of RAM or 
* _Distributed System_ to distribute the data to multiple machines
